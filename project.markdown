1. #### Graphene Oxide Elicits a Disparate Response of Monomers and Dimers of Methylene Blue: a  pectroscopic Analysis of Surface Adsorption

Varun started working on this project as a part of his 2019 summer internship under the guidance of Dr. Kabeer Jasuja, an Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of technology Gandhinagar (then an Assistant Proffesor). When Varun joined the BoRN research group and started working on this project, the problem was still unknown. The research group was trying to figure out the interfacial science behinfd adsorption of methylene blue (MB), a model organic cationic dye on graphene oxide (GO). Varun started getting familiar with the rudiments of experiemntal research under the guidance of two senior PhD students, Asha and Satadru. Thier guidance leveraged him to make the best out of the summer time and get comfortable in a research group environment. 

The summer internship was towards its end, however, the team wasn't able to make significant progress towards unveiling the governing phenomenon. Serendipitously, towards the bery end of his internship, Varun stumbled upon a novel method of presented the results in form of scatter/line plots. The idea struck to him because of Prof. Kabeer's suggestion for trying to make all different graphs that he could imagine of which could be used to show the result. On finally showing the graphs to Prof. Kabeer, they realized that they stumbled upon a unique method of respresenting adsorption of methylene blue at various graphene oxide concentrations. Following to these wonderful results, Prof. Kabeer suggested Varun to learn deconvolution and apply the same to the results obtianed. Varun decided to extend his internship and started working on the stumbled upon results. Eventually, he was able to connect some existing literature with their method of deconvolution to show unique results which manifested that monomers and dimers, which are the primary constitutents of MB, responded differently to GO while being adsorbed.

Finally this idea kept on developing over the months. Varun eventually wrote his first journal manuscript under this project which they are now planning to submit in the Journal of Chemical Physiscs under the special issue of 2D materials.

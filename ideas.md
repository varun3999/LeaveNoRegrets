This is the place where Varun dumps his ideas. These ideas are utually related to reseacrh based endeavours that Varun plans to execte sometime in near future

Some of the ideas that have struck randonly to his mind are:

1. Synthesisng boron based nanosheets with different solvents that are rich in chlorides, fluorides etc. This may help us come up with novel boron based composites for varied applications. The boron based sheets can possibly be functionalised by these halide functional groups just like thye get oxygenized while their regular sysntesis.

2. Extending the idea od isparate adsorption fo monomers and dimers in Boron based nanosheets. This would help us prove the phoenomenon to be universal in nature and something not very niche or specefic.
